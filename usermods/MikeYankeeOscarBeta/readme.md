## MikeYankeOscarBeta  Voron 2.4 9mm BFI for 9mm belts and 5x22mm pins
#### VoronDesign-Discord: MikeyMike V2.5796

Made to fit with the 9mm Belt mod XY idlers and AB stepper mounts found here: 
https://www.printables.com/model/485237-voron-24-9mm-gantry 
(which might also be this project on github: https://github.com/Sneeky-Pete/Fatso)

These replace the modded ramalama2 front idlers in the Etretti Voron 2.4 9mm gantry


## BFI 9mm belt mod for Voron 2.4

For V2.4 9mm BFI, you'll need:
- 4× M5×30 BHCS 
- 4× M5 hex nuts
- 2× 5mm-diameter pin, 22mm long
- 2× M3 t-nuts
- 2× M3×16 BHCS (i think, but might need londer)

...plus the 14mm shim/bearing stack setup for each idler, same as the 9mm belt mod front idlers.


Kudos to the voron community, and especially:
clee for the BFI BZI mod
Etretti / Sneeky-Pete for the 9mm mod
Johan/Alucardi V2.12171 V0.1479 for breaking his 9mm ramalama2 idlers
